# changelog

# version-2.0.4 | 4-6-2025

- Fixed the issue with errors being thrown on the client when a session participant executes an action with effects that have a node or output target from the METIS target environment tied to it
- Fixed the issue with notifications not being removed from the global state after they expire or are dismissed

# version-2.0.3 | 2-25-2025

- Fixed all known issues centered around executing an action on a node during a session

# version-2.0.2 | 2-20-2025

- Created a temporary (manual) solution for managing multiple users at once
- Bug fixes and performance enhancements to provide a better user experience

# version-2.0.1 | 1-17-2025

- Implemented the ability to give sessions a custom name

# version-2.0.0 | 1-10-2025

- Created a new property within missions called prototype nodes which are used to define the hierarchy structure of all nodes found throughout the forces within a mission
- Implemented a new property within missions called forces which are used to create multiple different views/experiences of the node hierarchy structure and provide support for multiplayer collaboration during mission execution
- Created a new system for executing missions called sessions. Sessions use server-side logic via a new WebSocket system to execute missions and provide initial support for multiplayer collaboration with features like assigning members to a force and assigning roles to members
- Refactored the API (Application Programming Interface) for organizational and security purposes
- Replaced the asset system with the target-effect system so that METIS (Modular Effects-Based Transmitter for Integrated Simulations) can communicate with other software and affect custom targets stored in those target environments. This will also allow other software to communicate with and modify certain targets within METIS (e.g. nodes within a specific force)
- Implemented a new user management system so that authorized users can create additional users
- Created a new permission-based system for METIS users that properly authorizes different users to perform different operations within METIS (a separate, but similar permission system is used for the session system)
- Created a system to alert authorized users of conflicts found within a mission, prompting them to address the issues and resolve them before launching a session
- Implemented a new system for displaying messages in the output panel. The new system uses server-side logic via a new WebSocket system and is compatible with the new target-effect system
- Developed a brand-new, more efficient, modular, and maintainable engine for the mission map
- Added file-store compatibility. This allows a file store to be maintained on the METIS server with the files being accessible via the API. Currently, there is no write, so all files must manually be placed into the file store
- Refactored the form fields to be more versatile and powerful when being used throughout METIS
- Various refactors, improvements, design changes, and bug fixes

# version-1.3.8 | 1-3-2024

- Fixed issue where actions within a mission that had a resource cost of 0 would result in an infinite amount of attempts to execute causing the app to break once that mission was selected

# version-1.3.7 | 12-6-2023

- Raised the memory limit for the JSON parser on the server from 100kb to 10mb

# version-1.3.6 | 11-9-2023

- Fixed styling issue with text displayed in the terminal (output panel) on the game page
- A new mission-node's description and pre-execution text no longer have default text since the properties are optional and can be saved to the database as empty strings

# version-1.3.5 | 10-25-2023

- Updated branding throughout the whole web application to use the new emblem and logo created for METIS

# version-1.3.4 | 10-6-2023

- Created a rich text editor in the Mission Form Page (Edit Mission Page) so that hyperlinks can be used and text can be emboldened, underlined, or italicized
- Created HTML sanitization so that the HTML being saved to the database is sanitized to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) and other malicious attacks
- Created logic for the output panel (terminal) in the Game Page to be able to read and display the rich text (i.e., hyperlinks) correctly
- Restructured the middleware functions that are used to validate data being sent to the database in the body, query, and params of a request via the API
- Various optimizations, bug fixes, and design changes to provide a better user experience

# version-1.3.3 | 7-25-2023

- Integrated with ASCOT

# version-1.3.2 | 7-7-2023

- Updated default missions that are generated when METIS is first set up

# version-1.3.1 | 7-3-2023

- Created a feature for missions to have an introduction message that displays in the terminal on the game page when a user selects a mission to go through
- Updated asset structure for cyber city to include effects for radar
- Updated the README.md for more detailed instructions on setting up an environment to use METIS
- Fixed bug with the color import feature
- Fixed bug where the traffic lights would not turn on/off by zone using the asset feature
- Minor design changes
- Various optimizations and other minor bug fixes and improvements

# version-1.3 | 6-14-2023

- Created new asset feature where the instructors will be able to affect assets (upon successful execution only) within cyber city via the PLC API
- Created a pagination design for the list of missions on the landing page
- Created a search filter feature for the mission selection page, or landing page, so that a user can quickly find a specific mission by typing in its name
- A list of assets can be saved to an individual mission
- Created middleware functions that ensure data passed to the API is properly vetted, and any invalid data is rejected before that data is used in the database
- Changed the validation function for the colors that are used for mission-nodes so that only hex color codes are stored in the database
- Every mission-node’s background matches the background color of the Mission Map, and the border color can be changed by the instructor
- Changed the logos and titles throughout the application from CESAR (Cyber Effects Simulator and Relay) to METIS (Modular Effects-Based Transmitter for Integrated Simulations)
- Changed how the import/export file extension worked so that missions that are exported will have a ".metis" extension instead of a ".cesar" file extension and the import feature will only except files with a ".metis" extension moving forward
- Changed the user interface for the border color selector in the edit mission page from text to color squares
- Removed arrowheads and junction points that were displayed from a parent node to its child node(s)
- Created a migration script to convert/update color properties from text strings to hex color codes
- Created VS Code Debugger so that developers can find and fix bugs within the web application more efficiently and effectively
- Created unit tests for every mission route on the API
- Created unit tests for the middleware functions to make sure that the middleware functions properly validate the type of each piece of data being sent, that the correct data is being sent, and that there is not a single piece of data missing within the request sent to the API
- Created additional tests for the import/export feature to make sure that only ".metis" files can be imported if the "schema build number" stored in the file equals 10 or more and ".cesar" files if the "schema build number" is 9 or less
- Created tests for the color validation function to make sure that only hex color codes can be stored in the database and anything else returns an internal server error (500) response
- Created a logging system for the asset feature when the PLC API is called
- Created a logging system for the tests when they are being run
- Minor design changes
- Various optimizations and other minor bug fixes and improvements
